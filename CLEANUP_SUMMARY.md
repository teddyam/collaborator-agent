# Chat Type Detection Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### üßπ Removed Manual Override System
- Removed `setChatTypeOverride()` and `clearChatTypeOverride()` methods from `CorePromptManager`
- Removed `chatTypeOverrides` Map from the class
- Removed manual override commands from `index.ts`:
  - `set.1on1`
  - `set.group` 
  - `clear.override`
  - `chat.type`

### üéØ Streamlined Implementation
- **Core functionality preserved**: Enhanced chat type detection still works using activity context and ID patterns
- **Automatic detection only**: System now relies purely on intelligent detection algorithms
- **Clean codebase**: Removed testing/debugging clutter for production use

### üìù Updated Documentation
- Removed references to manual override commands
- Updated usage examples to show only automatic detection
- Simplified testing recommendations

## What Remains

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Detection System
- **Activity Context Analysis**: Uses `activity.conversation.isGroup`, `conversationType`, etc.
- **ID Pattern Analysis**: Comprehensive pattern matching for Teams conversation IDs
- **Score-Based Fallback**: Handles edge cases with scoring algorithm
- **Detailed Logging**: Console output shows detection logic for debugging

### ‚úÖ Storage Optimization
- **1-on-1 chats**: Store user + AI messages
- **Group chats**: Store user messages only
- **Activity context persistence**: Remembers conversation context for accurate detection

### ‚úÖ Debug Commands
- **`msg.db`**: View database contents for debugging

## Result

The system is now production-ready with:
- No manual intervention required
- Clean, maintainable code
- Robust automatic detection
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Smart storage optimization based on chat type

The enhanced chat type detection system leverages Teams AI Library v2 best practices and handles both common and edge cases automatically.
