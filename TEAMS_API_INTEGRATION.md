# Teams API Integration for Action Items Agent

## Overview

The Action Items Agent has been enhanced to use the **Teams API** to get actual conversation members instead of parsing conversation history. This provides more accurate and up-to-date participant information for intelligent action item assignment.

## 🔄 Updated Architecture

### API Flow
```
User @mentions bot → mention event → processUserRequestWithAPI() → 
Manager with API access → delegateToActionItems() → 
Teams API: api.conversations.members(conversationId).get() → 
Action Items Agent with real participant list
```

### Fallback Strategy
- **Primary**: Use Teams API to get conversation members
- **Fallback**: Parse conversation history if API fails
- **Graceful degradation**: Always provides some participant list for assignment

## 📋 Implementation Details

### New Methods Added

#### 1. `CorePromptManager.processUserRequestWithAPI()`
```typescript
async processUserRequestWithAPI(conversationKey: string, userRequest: string, api: any): Promise<string>
```
- Entry point that passes Teams API to the manager
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `processUserRequest()`

#### 2. `ManagerPrompt.processRequestWithAPI()`
```typescript
async processRequestWithAPI(userRequest: string, conversationId: string, api: any): Promise<string>
```
- Stores API instance temporarily for delegation methods
- Cleans up API reference after processing

#### 3. `getConversationParticipantsFromAPI()`
```typescript
async getConversationParticipantsFromAPI(api: any, conversationId: string): Promise<string[]>
```
- Helper function to get participants from Teams API
- Handles different member object properties (name, givenName, displayName, etc.)

### Updated Delegation Logic

```typescript
private async delegateToActionItems(userRequest: string, conversationId: string): Promise<string> {
  let participants: string[] = [];

  // Try Teams API first
  if (this.currentAPI) {
    try {
      const members = await this.currentAPI.conversations.members(conversationId).get();
      participants = members.map(member => member.name || member.givenName || 'Unknown');
    } catch (apiError) {
      // Fallback to conversation history
      participants = getConversationParticipants(this.storage, conversationId);
    }
  } else {
    // No API available, use conversation history
    participants = getConversationParticipants(this.storage, conversationId);
  }
  
  // Continue with action items creation...
}
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Teams API Integration

### 1. **Accurate Member List**
- Gets current conversation members, not just message history
- Includes members who haven't sent messages recently
- Reflects current team composition

### 2. **Real-time Data**
- Always up-to-date participant information
- Handles team membership changes
- No dependency on message history completeness

### 3. **Rich Member Information**
- Access to member display names, email addresses, roles
- Better assignment logic based on actual team structure
- Future extensibility for member-based permissions

### 4. **Robust Fallback**
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- Maintains functionality in all scenarios
- Backward compatibility preserved

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Message History Only)
```typescript
// Limited to users who have sent messages
const participants = getConversationParticipants(storage, conversationId);
// Might miss: new team members, lurkers, inactive users
```

### After (Teams API + Fallback)
```typescript
// Gets ALL conversation members
const members = await api.conversations.members(conversationId).get();
const participants = members.map(member => member.name);
// Includes: all team members, even if they haven't sent messages
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Action Item Assignment with Real Members

**Before:**
```
@bot Create action items from our standup
// Only assigns to: John, Sarah (who sent messages)
```

**After:**
```
@bot Create action items from our standup  
// Can assign to: John, Sarah, Mike, Lisa, Alex (all team members)
```

### Better Assignment Logic
```
Available members from Teams API:
- John Smith (Product Manager)
- Sarah Johnson (Frontend Developer) 
- Mike Chen (Backend Developer)
- Lisa Wang (Designer)
- Alex Rodriguez (QA Engineer)

Action items created:
- "Review UI mockups" → Assigned to Lisa Wang (Designer)
- "Fix API integration" → Assigned to Mike Chen (Backend Developer)
- "Update product requirements" → Assigned to John Smith (Product Manager)
```

## 🛠️ Debug and Testing

### Debug Output Enhancement
The `action.items` debug command now shows source of participants:

```
📋 Action Items Debug Info:

👥 Participants Source: Teams API (5 members)
✅ Members: John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Mike Chen, Lisa Wang, Alex Rodriguez

Action Items for this conversation (3):
✅ #1 🔥 Review UI mockups
   👤 Assigned to: Lisa Wang
   📝 Review the dashboard designs and provide feedback
   📅 Created: 1/7/2025
```

### Testing Scenarios

1. **API Available**: Should get complete member list from Teams
2. **API Error**: Should fallback to conversation history gracefully  
3. **Mixed Team**: Should handle members who haven't sent messages
4. **Private Chat**: Should work correctly in 1:1 conversations

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Member Role Integration
```typescript
// Future: Use member roles for smarter assignment
const members = await api.conversations.members(conversationId).get();
const developers = members.filter(m => m.role?.includes('Developer'));
const managers = members.filter(m => m.role?.includes('Manager'));
```

### Presence-Based Assignment
```typescript
// Future: Consider member availability
const members = await api.conversations.members(conversationId).get();
const activeMebers = members.filter(m => m.presence === 'Available');
```

### Workload Balancing
```typescript
// Future: Balance assignments based on current workload
const memberWorkloads = await getActionItemsForUsers(members);
const leastBusyMember = members.sort((a, b) => 
  memberWorkloads[a.id] - memberWorkloads[b.id]
)[0];
```

## 🚀 Implementation Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Teams API integration for member retrieval
- Graceful fallback to conversation history
- Updated manager delegation with API access
- Enhanced participant detection

🔄 **Next Phase:**
- Personal DM interface for cross-conversation action items
- Member role-based assignment logic
- Workload balancing algorithms

The Action Items Agent now leverages the full power of the Teams API while maintaining robust fallback capabilities, providing more accurate and intelligent action item assignment! 🎯
